# EMERGENCY NETLIFY 404 FIX

## Current Issue
Still getting 404 error on Netlify live domain despite correct configuration.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO TRY

### Solution 1: Manual Netlify Dashboard Settings
1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Build & Deploy**
2. **Manually set these EXACT values:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Node version: 18
3. **Save settings**
4. **Go to Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy**

### Solution 2: Force Redirect Rules
1. **Go to Site Settings → Redirects and rewrites**
2. **Delete all existing redirects**
3. **Add this single redirect:**
   - From: `/*`
   - To: `/index.html`
   - Status: `200`
4. **Save and test**

### Solution 3: Check Build Output
1. **Go to Deploys tab**
2. **Click on latest deploy**
3. **Check if these files exist in build output:**
   - `index.html` (in root)
   - `_redirects` file
   - `assets/` folder with JS and CSS

### Solution 4: Alternative Redirect Format
If above doesn't work, try this in netlify.toml:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist/public"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

### Solution 5: Check Domain Settings
1. **Go to Site Settings → Domain management**
2. **Make sure you're accessing the correct domain**
3. **Check if there are any custom domain issues**

## DEBUGGING STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Build
```bash
npm run build
ls -la dist/public/
```
Should show: `index.html`, `_redirects`, `assets/`

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
cd dist/public
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000` - should work

### Step 3: Check Netlify Logs
1. Go to Deploys → Latest deploy
2. Check build logs for errors
3. Look for any warnings about redirects

## EMERGENCY FALLBACK

If nothing works, try this minimal setup:

1. **Delete netlify.toml temporarily**
2. **Rely only on _redirects file**
3. **Deploy and test**
4. **If it works, restore netlify.toml**

## CURRENT CONFIGURATION

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### _redirects (in dist/public/)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## TEST COMMANDS

```bash
# Test build
npm run build

# Check output
ls -la dist/public/

# Test redirects file
cat dist/public/_redirects

# Test index.html
head -5 dist/public/index.html
```

## NEXT STEPS

1. Try Solution 1 first (manual dashboard settings)
2. If that fails, try Solution 2 (manual redirects)
3. Check build logs for any errors
4. Test with minimal configuration if needed

The issue is likely in Netlify dashboard settings, not your code!
