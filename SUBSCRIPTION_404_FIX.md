# Subscription System 404 Error Fix

## Problem
The subscription plans page was showing a 404 error "Cannot POST /api/freelancer/subscriptions" as shown in the screenshot.

## Root Cause
The server was not running, which caused all API endpoints to return 404 errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Missing Dependencies
- **Installed `passport-google-oauth20`**: The server was failing to start due to missing OAuth dependency
- **Installed `@types/passport-google-oauth20`**: Added TypeScript types for the OAuth package
- **Installed `nanoid`**: Added missing utility package used by the server

### 2. Started Server Properly
- **Killed conflicting processes**: Removed processes using port 5000/3000
- **Started server on port 3000**: Used `$env:PORT=3000; npx tsx server/index.ts`
- **Verified server startup**: Confirmed server is running and responding

### 3. Verified API Endpoints
- **Categories API**: ✅ Working (returns 200)
- **Subscription API**: ✅ Working (returns 401 - authentication required, which is correct)
- **Client access**: ✅ Working (Vite middleware serving React app)

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Server not running
- ❌ 404 errors on all API endpoints
- ❌ Subscription plans page showing error

### After Fix
- ✅ Server running on port 3000
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Subscription API properly protected with authentication
- ✅ Client accessible through server

## How to Test

1. **Open the application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login as freelancer**: Use Google OAuth or phone authentication
3. **Access subscription plans**: Navigate to Plans page
4. **Verify functionality**: Should load without 404 errors

## Server Status
- **Port**: 3000
- **Status**: Running
- **API**: Working
- **Client**: Served through Vite middleware

## Files Modified
- `package.json`: Added missing dependencies
- `vite.config.ts`: Cleaned up proxy configuration
- Server configuration: Fixed startup issues

The subscription system should now work correctly without any 404 errors.
